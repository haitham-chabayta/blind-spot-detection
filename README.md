# Object in blind spot detection project

Blind spot detection is an cross-platform ionic application that alerts users for a threat in his blind spot while driving if detected. The application gathers data from the database to know if there is an object in the blind spot. The info in the database is constintoly updated by an arduino that has an ultrasonic connected to it to detect objects. 

# This Repo presents the arduino codes and the application code
